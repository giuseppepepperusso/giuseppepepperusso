#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity #in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R #programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, #and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Computer Science Department at EPFL, supervised by Rober West and adviced by Manoel Horta Ribeiro at the DLab Group. Previously, I got my Ph.D. at ETH Zurich, where I was advised by Frank Schweitzer

I am working to broaden the use of causal methods to address societal issues and promote social good. I leverage large language models, data science and causal inference to improve decision-making across multiple applications areas. I have a strong interest in social media analysis, suistanability studies questions, especially those that require a causal understanding of human behaviours to improve decisions.
